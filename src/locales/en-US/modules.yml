  about: "**TICKET'S MODULE**\n\n
**What is the Ticket Module?**\n
The ticket module comes together with a system responsible for organizing the support of players, basically providing a command for the members of the server to ask questions, report bugs or review punishments.\n\n
**How does the Ticket System work?**\n
Members have a command called `{{ prefix }}open-ticket`, when carrying out the command, a list of information is generated asking what the member wants to talk to the support for, when choosing the category a channel will be the one created for the service."
